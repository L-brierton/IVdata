Information Visualisation of Car Dataset

Dataset used available here: https://data.gov.ie/dataset/2016-make-model-year-failures-at-nct, it describes 2016 Make Model Year Failures at NCT

I first began by cleaning the data, such as removing empty lines at the start of the data file.

I created three sets of visualisation based on the core questions I wanted to ask: How do the pass rates differ across car makes? Is there a relationship between car condition and likelyhood of passing the NCT?

From these questions I created a total of 4 visualisations written in JSON and displayed Vega-lite (https://vega.github.io/editor/#/custom/vega-lite). These visualisations were then embedded into HTML files for a cleaner presentation.
