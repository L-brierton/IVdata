<td style="vertical-align: top;">This line graph shows the change in pass rates over time for each of the 10 most popular makes of cars in Ireland for 2016 (from this <a href="https://www.independent.ie/life/motoring/car-news/revealed-irelands-top-10-best-selling-cars-in-2016-35179498.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>) for the past 20 years (1996 - 2016). Each line is coloured according to the car make they represent.</td>

<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> This line chart shows what we would expect, that newer cars tend to perform better on the NCT as compared to older cars. However, this trend isn't perfect, and we see a sharp dip in <i>Audi</i> in 2015 while <i>Ford</i> dips significantly in 2016. This is likely due to smaller sample sizes as people are less likely to have newer cars.which I anticipated to have the heaviest athletes, ranks quite far down the list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> I have used a line chart as they are very good at representing change over time. By colouring the lines based on the car make they represent it increases the usability of the chart. I also filtered the data to only include the 10 most popular cars as to avoid overplotting and make the chart more readable. It also allowed those with little car knowledge to easily identify popular car makes and compre them. I also did this to avoidsmall sample sizes that would the margin of error and obscure the trend. Similarly, I filter only the last 20 years to avoid the small sample sizes of older cars and the less items tested that led to more extreme pass/fail rates. </td></tr>
